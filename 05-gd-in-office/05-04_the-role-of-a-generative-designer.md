# The Role of a Generative Designer

The generative designer is someone in charge of using, maintaining and exploring practical applications for generative design in their work environment. 

The role can involve one or more people, so it is important to define their responsibilities correctly. Some of the possible responsibilities of a generative designer are described below.

## Identifying the Possible Problems

Although identifying a possible problem for generative design may seem like a straightforward task, making sure that the problem contains certain characteristics that are worth solving may cause this responsibility to become more complex. 

Some of the criteria that should be considered include: making sure the problem is relevant to the scale of your office; framing problems so they can be reused in different contexts; and making sure the complexity of the problem is manageable by your generative design team.

## Workflow Creation

Workflow creation deals with the nuts and bolts of generative design. This person would be responsible for creating the actual workflow and relations for variables, results and evaluation criteria. 

The ideal candidate for this role would be skilled in Dynamo and visual programming, as much of their time would be spent in developing workflows within this platform.

## Evaluation

Ideally, this would be someone outside of the generative design process - someone who is aware of the team needs who can be more objective in evaluating how useful, relevant and efficient the generative design workflows were.
