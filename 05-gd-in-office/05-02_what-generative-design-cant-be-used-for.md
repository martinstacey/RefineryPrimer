# What Generative Design Can’t Be Used For?

If you want to implement Generative Design for Revit in your office it is important to understand what generative design can and cannot do, and communicate it correctly to your peers. Unrealistic expectations may lead to a level of mistrust within potential users and could risk losing further interest in investing in generative design applications.

## **Myths and Misconceptions:**

Although generative design is great at solving problems, there are certain problems that are usually assigned to generative design that should not be. Guiding a team into allocating the appropriate amount of time and effort into the most applicable problems can be just as important as solving the problem itself. Some of the common mistakes are described below:

### **Evident Solutions**

One of the advantages of generative design is that it may help you clarify multiple dimensionality and complexity that go way beyond human understanding. Although some of the examples presented in this primer are simple, the true potential of generative design is achieved by incorporating conflicting criteria and the right amount of complexity. To avoid wasting time and ensure generative design becomes a valuable resource, focus on problems that do not have evident solutions. If your problem delivers evident solutions you may be lacking variables. ****

### Confusing Visual Programming Problems with Generative Design Problems

Even though Generative Design works with Dynamo, it is important to differentiate between problems that need an automated process and problems that need exploration. In general terms, if you intend to solve a problem that deals with automation use Dynamo, whereas if you intend to explore multiple solutions use Generative Design.

### Problem is Not Defined in Terms of Variables

A generative design problem needs a set of variables/inputs. These inputs need to be manipulated and their variation should result in a design space to explore. If the design space is too limited, Generative Design is not able to show heterogeneous results. 

### No Clear Relationship Between Variables and Intention

Unfortunately, generative design can’t define your design’s intent. It would be similar to asking Google for the meaning of life. If you don’t have clear goals to evaluate or clear ways of defining which designs are acceptable then Generative Design can’t help you. There should also be a clear understanding on how the intent relates to your inputs.
