# Is Generative Design Machine Learning?

Although many people are using machine learning as an industry buzzword, it is important to differentiate between the terms 'generative design' and 'machine learning'. 

Essentially, the answer is no, generative design is not machine learning. While machine learning is used to analyse and predict, generative design creates and generates.

The diagram above shows how these terms differ in their processes. You can think of machine learning as a pattern finder and generative design as a creator.
