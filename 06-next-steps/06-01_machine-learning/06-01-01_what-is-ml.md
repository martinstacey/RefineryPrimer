# What is Machine Learning?

Machine learning \(ML\) has become an area of interest over the last few years. From virtual assistants to financial data interpretation, ML has become an important tool in creating models to explain data behaviour. 

Rather than trying to define ML here, we suggest that you visit the following sites to get more in-depth information of the subject. For the purposes of this chapter, we will assume that you have a basic understanding of ML and will focus on the key aspects that relate to generative design.

## What is Machine Learning?

Machine learning \(in this context\) is a way of analysing data and using it to predict future behaviours.

### So Why the Big Hype?

Due to the immense amount of data that we have and produce in contemporary society, these methods have become an extremely useful, powerful, accurate and efficient way of exploring data. ML has many applications, from classifying cancerous cells from images to predicting whether or not a costumer will buy a product.
