# Hello Generative Design for Revit and Dynamo!

In this chapter, weâ€™ll look at how we can use generative design principles to solve real-world design problems. We will do this by looking at a few common design challenges.

Although a generative design approach may sounds complex, it's important to remember that it's not limited to solving complex design problems; it can solve simple ones too. 

In fact, once a designer has a computational design process set up, generative design approaches can help solve design questions easily, eliminating large amounts of manual work for easy and complex design problems alike.
