# Data

Data is the fundamental 'stuff' that you feed into your optimization model - the inputs and outputs that the objective function and constraints use to produce design solutions.

In design, data could be the density or price of construction materials, how many hours of sunlight a room can expect to receive in a day, or any goals that are important to your design exploration that you can define mathematically. In finance, data could be the assets you can buy or sell, and their prices; or, in the aerospace industry, data could be the unit weights and costs of carrying a certain kind of fuel. 

The optimization model in Generative Design takes data and uses it to maximize or minimize the values \(as per the designer's specifications\). The raw data \(either the input data for generation or the output data from the generative process\) and how it is organized will determine how easy it will be to navigate different possible solutions and find the most suitable \(optimal\) one.

Real-world optimization problems are invariably solved algorithmically and there are often many algorithms that can solve the same problem. The most common algorithm used in Generative Design for architectural and engineering workflows is called the 'genetic algorithm'. We will cover this later on.
