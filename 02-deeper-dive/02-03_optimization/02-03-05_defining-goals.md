# Defining Goals

Know your design parameters inside and out!

Every good generative design project starts with a clear and precise understanding of the design problem and a clear description of the goals. Algorithms are great at churning through thousands of design options very quickly, but they donâ€™t perform nearly as well when given vague or imprecise instructions. You must be able to define your problem in a mathematical way \(i.e. with some sort of number that can be used to rank outcomes\).

Some good questions to ask when formulating design goals are:

* What do you want to achieve?  
* What features must your ideal design have? 
* What features cannot appear in your ideal design? 
* Do you simply want to see a lot of design options? 
* Do you want to optimise your design for some specific characteristic? 
* Do you want to optimise your design for multiple competing characteristics? 
* What would you like to maximize? And why? 
* What would you like to minimize? And why? 
* Can your maximization or minimization question be quantified mathematically? If so, how precisely?

Being able to confidently answer at least some of the above, is a good first step to home in on precisely what objectives your computational procedure should have.
