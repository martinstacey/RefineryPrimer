# Constraints

![](../../.gitbook/assets/constrains.png)

A constraint is a condition that a solution of an optimization problem must satisfy. In the table example, constraints may include the following:

* The table must have four legs 
* The table must be at least 50 centimeters wide 
* The table may be no more than 1 metre tall 
* The table cannot be blue 

Constraints give a model its realism; they confine the solution to only take realistic values or values that the user knows are critical to the design brief. If a model is unconstrained, it is likely to return absurd and unrealistic results that arenâ€™t of any practical use \(a circular table that is three metres high with a single leg that balances on a point, for instance\). Constraints are vital as they ensure that a generative design algorithm outputs something realistic and reasonable.
