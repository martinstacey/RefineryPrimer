# Evaluation Phase

## What do you mean by ‘fitness’?

A fitness function is essentially the objective function for the genetic algorithm; it's the criterion you want to maximize or minimize, the thing you care most about achieving. A fitness function is used to evaluate how close \(or far\) a given design solution is from achieving the designer’s goals. The genetic algorithm is designed to drive the model to higher and higher fitness, so defining a fitness function precisely and accurately is vital.

Some examples of fitness functions that could be used in a Generative Design context include:

* Maximize hours of daylight for each desk in an office 
* Maximize circulation in common areas 
* Minimize number of distinct types of parts needed to assemble an object 
* Minimize number of total parts needed to assemble an object 
* Maximize the structural strength of a critical component in a product  
* Minimize the fuel needed to power a vehicle 
* Minimize the weight of a design 

You can see here that these suggestions are always framed as either a maximization or minimization problem. As discussed above, this formulation is crucial for an optimization approach to be effective.

Another consideration is that it is desirable for fitness functions to be calculated very efficiently by a computer. That is, a good fitness function can be calculated fast. With experience, a user comes to learn which kinds of fitness functions are likely to be particularly fast or slow.

One of the great strengths of a genetic approach is that the fitness function can be quite complicated. In fact, a single genetic model can have multiple competing fitness functions or even a single fitness function that is a combination of several others \(minimize the weight of a design while also making it as structurally sound as possible, for example\). This is also known as Multi Objective Optimization and Single Objective Optimization.

Only once a fitness function has been defined can the selection phase of a genetic algorithm begin.
