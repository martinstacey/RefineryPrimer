# Genetic Algorithms

![](../../.gitbook/assets/genetic.png)

In this section, weâ€™ll look at the term _`Generative Algorithms`_

We will cover the following:

* [what is a genetic algorithm?](02-04-01_what-is-a-genetic-algorithm.md)
* [inizialization phase](02-04-02_initialization-phase.md)
* [evaluation phase](02-04-03_evaluation-phase.md)
* [selection phase](02-04-04_selection-phase.md)
* [crossover phase](02-04-05_crossover-phase.md)
* [mutation phase](02-04-06_mutation-phase.md)
