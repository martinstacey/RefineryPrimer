# Crossover Phase

This is the breeding stage. Crossover can be very complex, but at a basic level, two “parent” solutions are selected to be bred. Some proportion of each parent’s features are selected and swapped \(i.e., crossed-over\) with the other’s, thereby generating a pair of “offspring” solutions that are similar, but not identical to, their parents. The new offspring will be a combination of some of parent one's features and some of parent two's.

The goal, of course, is for the offspring to be fitter than their parents. In general, after each round of breeding, the average fitness score of the population will have increased \(although this is by no means guaranteed\). This occurs since only the most fit parents are selected for crossover. Repeating the selection and crossover process leads to greater average fitness with each successive generation. The intention is to converge to the best possible fitness.
