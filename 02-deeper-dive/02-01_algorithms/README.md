In this chapter, weâ€™ll look at:

* [what are algorithms?](02-01-01_what-are-algorithms.md)
* [learn about generators](02-01-02_generators.md)
* [learn about evaluators](02-01-03_evaluators.md)
* [understand what a solver is](02-01-04_solvers.md)
* and how Refinery behaves as a solver

First, let's understand what the term _`algorithms`_ means in relation to AEC and generative design.
