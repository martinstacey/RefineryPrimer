# What are Algorithms?

There has been a sudden hype towards algorithms, mystifying them and giving them false pretences that go way beyond what they do, but in essence an algorithm can be thought of as:

> A set of instructions that typically help to solve a problem.

**Algorithms in generative design**

A generative design approach involves several distinct steps with distinct kinds of algorithms to encode logic at each step. The types of methods used in each step are very different from each other, so we generally categorize them as follows:

| Step | Algorithm Type |
| :--- | :--- |
| generation of new design studies | generators |
| evaluation of each study | evaluators |
| ranking & solution achieves goal | solvers |
