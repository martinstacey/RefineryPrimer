There are many techniques that can be used to tackle a Computational Design problem. In addition to the genetic algorithm, other examples include:

* Solving with pen and paper 
* Manual guess and check 
* Set packing or partitioning algorithms 
* Gradient descent  
* Stochastic \(aka Random\) Local Search and then filtering results to desired maximum, minimum, or median values.
* Linear, Integer, or Quadratic programming  

Some of these techniques are quite basic and easy to implement \(see [Optioneering section](https://github.com/martinstacey/RefineryPrimer/tree/496f204f835e39d17e57c89b84d64d051c2398ae/03-optioneering/03-01_what-is-optioneering.md)\), others are far more sophisticated. Choosing the right technique for your application is a tricky question and much more of an art than a science. Often, it comes down to the precise design question you are tackling and your familiarity with a given technique.
