# Welcome

Welcome to the **Generative Design Primer**. This document aims to introduce AEC practitioners of all experience levels to an exciting, new approach to design: generative design workflows.

## About

This primer will help you to:

* **understand** what generative design is by defining the base concepts and terminology you need to know;
* **explore** how these techniques can be used to solve practical challenges commonly found in AEC design projects; and
* **learn** how to use Autodesk’s newest generative design tools such as Generative Design for Revit and Dynamo, through practical workflows.

## Why Make a Primer?

Autodesk is working to **democratize technologies** that can help designers in the AEC industry automate the creation of design options and optimise those designs to achieve better outcomes.

Using these technologies requires new skills and new ways to think about design. We created this primer to explain the terminology, ideas and methods you'll need to begin using generative design workflows and tools that support it.

_Note: There are many different applications of generative design/art and this primer does not aim to cover them all. This primer is focused on AEC methodologies and how these apply to both Generative Design and Dynamo._

**matterlab** was commissioned to kick-start the development of this primer. We thank them for all their efforts in establishing this valuable resource.

## Open-Source

This primer is an open-source project initiated by the **AEC Generative Design Team** at Autodesk. In this project, we are dedicated to providing high-quality content on Generative Design for Revit and the generative design processes.

Contributions are of course welcome. You can contribute to the primer in the following ways:

* You can report any issues on our [issues page](https://github.com/DynamoDS/GenerativePrimer/issues).
* If you’d like to improve, clarify, or add content to this document, please head over to our [Github repository](https://github.com/DynamoDS/GenerativePrimer).
* If you have an example workflow of generative design that you'd like to share with this community, please head over to our [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/DynamoDS/RefineryPrimer/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to find out more about how to do it.
