Machine learning has become a popular area of interest in the last few years. From virtual assistants to financial data interpretation, machine learning has become an important tool in creating models to explain data behaviour. We suggest that you visit the following sites to get more in depth information of the subject, as we would look at it briefly, and would only focus on key aspects that relate to the AEC industry and in particular generative design.

## What is Machine Learning?

Machine learning \(for our concern\) are methods for analysing data as well as predicting behaviours according to this data.

### So Why the Big Hype?

Due to the immense amount of data that we currently have this methods have become way powerful and accurate. Going from classifying cancerous cells from images to predicting if a costumer would by a product or not. Remember that you can use many more variables that a single mind can visualize.
