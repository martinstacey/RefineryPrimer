Visual Programming is a form of coding that, unlike textual programming, does not require compiling code or familiarity with a textual programming language \(like C\# or Python\). Instead, it uses a **visual interface** where a user **connects small nodes** **of pre-defined functionality**. Together, these nodes form a larger network of functionality that can achieve complex goals. This approach is easier to learn and makes tasks that were previously reserved for expert coders accessible to everyone.

Recently there has been a significant shift in the AEC industry towards Visual Programming. These tools are becoming commonplace in many organizations, especially as the move away from traditional CAD \(Computer Aided Design\) tools accelerates. While there will always be a place for CAD tools, Visual Programming applications enable a new approach to design. Design need no longer be a series of static modelling operations, but rather a dynamic, customizable flow of tasks.
