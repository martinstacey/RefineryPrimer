# Dynamo

**What is Dynamo?**

Dynamo is an [open-source](https://github.com/DynamoDS/Dynamo) visual programming application from Autodesk that

> aims to be accessible to both non-programmers and programmers alike. It gives users the ability to visually script behavior, define custom pieces of logic, and run custom code segments using various textual programming languages

Dynamo can be used as a stand-alone product \(Sandbox\) or can plug into other products such as Revit \(Dynamo for Revit\).
