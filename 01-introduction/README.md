We will look at the following topics:

* the fundamental concepts needed to understand generative design
* a definition of generative design in the context of AEC
* an introduction to Generative Design for Revit and Dynamo
* examples of using generative design to solve design problems
* related concepts
* common approaches used

Let’s start by first looking at something you’re very likely to be aware of and already using today: computational design.
