# Anatomy of Each Stage

Each of these stages can be further broken down into _`define`_, _`run`_ and _`results`_ steps. The _`define`_ step is the responsibility of the designer, while the _`run`_ and _`results`_ steps are performed by the computer.

Using this breakdown, let's look at what the_`generate`_ stage would entail.

### Define

For the _`define`_ step, the designer will need to do the following:

* Establish the generation algorithm - this is the logic that defines how designs are generated, which may include things like constraints and rules.
* Provide the generation parameters - these are the variables or inputs needed for the previously-defined algorithm.

This _`define`_ step is present and vital for all stages of the generative design process, as the validity of outputs relies on the quality of the designerâ€™s contribution in this step. 

With clear and concise logic, the computer can provide suitable outputs.

### Run

Once everything is defined in the algorithm and its accompanying parameters, the computer begins to _`run`_, meaning it starts to generate different design options. This process might happen locally on the designer's computer or, for more intensive calculations, it may happen using cloud computing.

### Results

The things that are generated during the _`run`_ step are the final outputs from each stage. These are then used as inputs or parameters in subsequent phases. 

For example, the designs created in the _`generate`_ phase will be used as one of input parameters in the _`analysis`_ phase.

## Overall Process

We can map these stages and steps together in a single diagram, allowing us to visualize the order of each stage and their dependencies.

The diagram shows us that:

* Each stage and step is dependent on the previous one.
* The entire study process is repeatable, as each iteration learns from the previous results.
