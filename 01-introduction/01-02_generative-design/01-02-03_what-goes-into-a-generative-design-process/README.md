# What Goes Into a Generative Design Process?

## Stages

As previously discussed, a generative design approach allows for a more integrated workflow between human and computer. 

In Generative Design, this workflow involves the following stages: generative ,analyze , rank, evolve, explore, and integrate.

### Generate

The design options are created or generated by the system, using algorithms and parameters specified by the designer.

### Analyze

The designs generated in the previous step are now measured or analyzed based on how well they achieve goals defined by the designer.

### Rank

The design options are ordered or ranked based on the results of the analysis.

### Evolve

The process ranks the design options to figure out which direction they should be further developed or evolved into.

### Explore

The designer compares and explores the generated designs, inspecting both the geometry and evaluation results.

### Integrate

The designer chooses a favorite design option and integrates it into the wider project or design work.
