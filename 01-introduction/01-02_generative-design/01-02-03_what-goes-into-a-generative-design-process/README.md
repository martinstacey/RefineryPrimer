# What goes into a Generative Design Process?

## Stages

As previously discussed, generative design allows for a more integrated **workflow between human and computer**, and as a result both are required to undertake a series of steps that allow the process to take place. These steps can be categorized into the following stages: **generate, analyze, rank, evolve, explore, integrate.**

**Generate** This is the stage when design options are created or generated by the system, using algorithms and parameters specified by the designer.

**Analyze:** The designs generated in the previous step are now measured, or analyzed on how well they achieve goals defined by the designer.

**Rank**: Based on the results of the analysis, design options are ordered or ranked.

**Evolve**: The process will use the ranking of the design options to figure out in which direction designs should be further developed or evolved

**Explore**: Generated designs are compared or explored by the designer, inspecting both the geometry and evaluation results.

**Integrate**: After choosing a favorite design option, the designer uses or integrates this design into the wider project or design work.
