# What Generative Design Canâ€™t Be Used For?

If you want to implement Refinery in your office it is important to understand what Generative Design can and cannot do, and communicate it to your peers. False expectations may lead stakeholders to mistrust Generative Design and could risk losing interest in investing in further applications.

## **Myths and Misconceptions:**

Although Generative Design is great at solving problems, there are certain problems that are usually assigned to Generative Design that should not be. Some of the common mistakes are:

### **Evident Solutions**

One of the advantages of Refinery is that it may help you clarify multiple dimensionality and complexity that go way beyond human understanding. Although some of the examples presented in this primer are simple the true potential of Refinery is achieved by incorporating conflicting criteria and right amount of complexity. To avoid wasting time and make Refinery a valuable resource focus on problems that do not have evident solutions. If your problem delivers evident solutions you may be lacking variables. ****

### Confusing Visual Programming Problems with Generative Design Problems

Even though refinery works with dynamo it is important to differentiate between problems that need a certain answer and problems that need exploration. If you intend on solving a problem that has a definite answer use dynamo, if you intend to explore solutions use refinery.

### Problem Is Not Defined in Terms of Variables

A generative design problem needs a set of variables/inputs. These inputs need to be manipulated and their variation should result in a design space to explore. If the design space is too limited, Refinery would not be able to show heterogeneous answers. 

### There Is No Clear Correlation Between How Inputs Affect Optimization Criteria

If there is no definite relation between how inputs affect optimization then refinery can be misguided into interpreting variables in a way that they are not intended. May develop results that were misguided by the malfunctioning workflow.
