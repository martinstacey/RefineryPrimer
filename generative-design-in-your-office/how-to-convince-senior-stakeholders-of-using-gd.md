# How to Convince Senior Stakeholders of Using Generative Design?

One of the key ideas of Refinery is to make generative design accessible and functional to people external to AEC technology. This is why Refinery is determined to solve real world problems and situations in the daily live of an architect/engineer practitioner.

## Convincing Seniors/Stakeholders

If you are clear that Refinery can improve performance in your office and you are confident that with Refinery you can explore a design spectrum unlikely reached through traditional methods,  how could you communicate this to somebody who is not aware of generative design and who would likely have little interest in getting to the nuts and bolts of generative design.

Below are some tips that may help you explain/convince senior stakeholders and people outside of the AEC technology spectrum to use or invest in refinery:

### Focus on practical issues local to your practice

Instead of focusing on the available possibilities Refinery can offer, start by thinking of day to day concerns you may address in your practice. Analyse what is keeping your firm to be more productive, and ask if Refinery can help you solve it.

### Start with easy problems

Start with easy and small problems to later on tackle bigger and more complex problems. Do not adress If you are fasing either break some of your design  don’t go straight to solving the most complex problems your office has.

### Make reasonable time frames for solving a problem.

Every problem you intend on solving should be allocated to a time frame. This would make it easier to evaluate which problems should be tackled first, because they would be more efficient to solve.

### Don’t oversell it

If you first tell people you are going to solve all of their problems you would be expected to do so. So create expectations that you can fulfil later on.
