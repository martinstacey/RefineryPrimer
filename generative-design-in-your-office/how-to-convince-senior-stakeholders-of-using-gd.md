## Introducing Project Refinery to Stakeholders

One of the key ideas of project refinery is to make generative design accessible and functional to people external to AEC technology. This is why project refinery is determined to solve real world problems and situations in the daily live of an architect engineer practitioner.

### Convincing Seniors/Stakeholders

So you are clear that refinery can improve your work at your office. You are confident that with this tool you can explore many more options solve problems quicker etc. So how could you communicate this to somebody who is not aware that generative design exists and who would probably have little interest in getting to the nuts and bolts of generative design.

Here are some tips that may help you explain/ convince to senior stakeholders and people outside of the AEC technology spectrum to use or invest in refinery.

### Focus on practical issues local to your practice



Instead of first selling the possibilities refinery has focus on problem solving day to day issues to your practice. Analyse what is keeping your firm to be more productive, and ask if refinery can help you solve this problem.

### Start with easy problems

Start with easy and small problems, don’t go straight to solving the most complex problems your office has.

### Make reasonable time frames for solving a problem.

Every problem you intend on solving should be allocated to a time frame. This would make it easier to evaluate which problems should be tackled first, because they would be more efficient to solve.

### Don’t oversell it

If you first tell people you are going to solve all of their problems you would be expected to do so. So create expectations that you can fulfil later on.
