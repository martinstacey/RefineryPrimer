# What Generative Design Can Be Used For?

![](../.gitbook/assets/gdcanbeusedfor.png)

Generative design helps with problems that are common to design practitioners that do not have a clear solution or path to resolve. As designers we often encounter problems with more than one possible solution, complex inter-dependencies, and contradictory requirements. We may have a good idea of what a building may require to be properly designed, but no straightforward recipe to achieve it. This is often defined as a [wicked problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_problem), and this are the type of problems generative design is used for.
