# The Role of a Generative Designer

The generative designer is someone in charge of using / maintaining / exploring practical applications for  generative design in an intended work environment. The role can have one or multiple people so it is important to define responsabilities within the generative design role. Some of the possible responsibilities would be described below:

### Identifying Possible Problem:

Although identifying a possible problem for Refinery may seem to be an undemanding task, making sure that problems comply certain criteria to be worth solving may cause this responsibility to become more complex. Some of the criteria to be aware of are: making sure the problem is relatable to the scale of your office; framing problems so they are replicable in different contexts your office may encounter; making sure the complexity of the problem is manageable by your generative design team.

### Workflow Creation

Workflow creation deals with the nuts and bolts of Refinery. This role would be responsible for creating the actual workflow and relations for variables, results and evaluation criteria. A person who would ideally take this role should be prolific in dynamo and visual programming; as much of his/her time would be spent in developing workflows on this interface.

### Evaluation

This should desirably be someone external to the generative design process or aware of the company/office needs, this would allow him/her to be more objective in evaluating how the generative design workflows were relevant and usefull to the company and how time-effective they were.
