# The role of a Generative Designer

The generative designer is someone in charge of using / maintaining / exploring practical applications for the use of generative design in an intended work environment. You can have one or multiple people in your generative design team so you should define accurately the roles needed to implement generative design.

### Team roles:

Regardless of the size of the team intended to work on generative design projects. There are certain roles that have to be taken. This can be assigned to a single person or to many people depending on the size of the group. Some of the roles include:

### Identify possible problem:

Although this task may be seen as straightforward it is really important to define problems in your office that could use generative design. This problems have to be parameter driven, simple workflow a desired set of criteria output. To fulfil this roll one must have a really clear notion of both how generative design works and what problems are dealt with in a daily basis in the office. This person should also allocate resources and get a clear idea of the timeframe that this problem would require.

### Workflow Creation

Workflow creation is the nuts and bolts of project refinery. This is the person who takes a deep dive and creates the actual workflow to solve the problem. This person should be prolific in dynamo and visual programming as much of his time would be spend in developing workflows here.

### Evaluator

This should desirably be someone external to the generative design process but really aware of the company/office needs, this allows him/her to be more objective in actually evaluating if the generative design workflows were useful and relevant to the company and time wise effective.
