# Setting Up a Graph for Generative Design

## Inputs

To set up a Dynamo graph for Generative Design right-click on each node used to drive the graph and ensure that the *`Is Input`* option is ticked. Renaming the node with a standard approach such as *`IN_description`* will help to distinguish these inputs in Generative Design.

\(Note: currently all inputs must be number slider nodes\)

## Outputs

To define outputs in Generative Design, right-click on the watch nodes and select the *`Is Output`* option. Renaming the node with a standard approach such as *`OUT_description`* will help to distinguish these outputs in Generative Design.

\(Note: currently all outputs must be watch nodes with a data type of Number\).

Generative Design would proceed to create a copy of your graph and would be available to launch. Remember that graphs that have the same name would be overwritten.
